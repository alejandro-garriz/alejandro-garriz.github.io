A course for students in their third year of the math degree. We start introducing some existence and uniquenes results together with some notable examples and solving techniques for first order ODEs. After that they learn about systems of ODEs, exponentiation of matrices and eigenvalues & eigenvectors methods. We finish the course discussing some famous problems like the predator-prey model or the pendulum system.
